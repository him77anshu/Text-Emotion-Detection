# Text Emotion Detection 
A machine learning project to detect emotions from text using Python. --- 
## Dataset Used - **Source:** The dataset is located in the `data/` directory. - **Description:** The dataset contains labeled text samples, each with a 
corresponding emotion tag (e.g., joy, anger, sadness, etc.).   
*(If you are using a specific dataset such as Kaggle's Emotion Dataset, 
please specify here.)* --- 
## Approach Summary 
### 1. Preprocessing - **Text Cleaning:** Text data is cleaned and tokenized. - **Normalization:** Stopwords are removed and text is converted to 
lowercase. 
### 2. Feature Extraction - **Vectorization:** Text features are extracted using TF-IDF 
vectorization. 
### 3. Modeling - **Classifier Training:** A machine learning classifier (e.g., Logistic 
Regression, SVM, or a simple Neural Network) is trained on the processed 
features to predict the emotion label. 
### 4. Deployment - **Web Application:** The trained model is deployed via a simple web app 
using `app.py`, allowing users to input text and receive emotion 
predictions. ---
