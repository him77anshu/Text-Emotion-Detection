## ðŸ§  Approach Summary

### ðŸ”§ 1. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and tokenized the text.
- Removed stopwords and punctuation.
- Applied text normalization techniques like stemming or lemmatization.

### ðŸ¤– 2. Model Building
- Vectorized the text using TF-IDF.
- Trained a Multinomial Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression / SVM classifier.
- Tuned hyperparameters for optimal accuracy.

### ðŸ“ˆ 3. Evaluation
- Accuracy and F1-score metrics were used.
- Achieved high precision across major emotion classes.

### ðŸ§© 4. Deployment
- Developed a front-end using Streamlit for easy user interaction.
- Integrated trained model (text_emotion.pkl) with app.py.
